# 🖥️ Python Data Analysis Projects
Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio built using Python!
This repository showcases a collection of projects where I’ve applied data analysis techniques to explore datasets, uncover insights, and solve real-world problems using Python libraries and tools.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas – Data manipulation & cleaning
- NumPy – Numerical operations
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – Basic machine learning (in some projects)
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive coding and analysis
- Excel / CSV / APIs – Data sources

### 🗂️ Repository Structure
Each folder includes:

- The main Python script or Jupyter notebook
- Dataset used for the analysis
- A README with project-specific insights and summary
  - 📁 Featured Project
  - 📈 Sales Data Analysis
  - Cleaned and analyzed monthly sales data
  - Identified top-performing products and regions
  - Created visualizations for trends and KPIs

### 🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-data-analysis-projects.git

Navigate to a project folder.

Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook

Or run the Python script: python analysis.py

### 📈 Learning Objectives
- These projects helped me strengthen my skills in:
= Data cleaning and wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization and storytelling with data
- Drawing insights to support decision-making
