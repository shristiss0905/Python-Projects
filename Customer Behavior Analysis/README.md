## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Using a dataset of online shoppers, we explore:

- **Demographics**: Age and gender distributions
- **Behavioral Trends**: Product browsing time, total pages viewed

## ðŸ“Š Key Visual Insights

- **Age Distribution**: Most customers fall between the ages of 18 and 28, indicating the majority are Gen Z and young millennials.
  
- **Gender Distribution**: While the gender split is relatively balanced, female customers tend to view slightly more pages on average than males, suggesting greater browsing engagement.

- **Device Usage**: Customers on mobile and tablet devices view slightly more pages than those on desktops. This highlights the importance of mobile-first design and optimization.

- **Browsing Time vs. Pages Viewed**: A weak positive correlation exists. While browsing time slightly influences page views, it's not a strong predictor, hinting at the impact of other factors like layout, content, or navigation ease.

- **Churn Rate**: A portion of users showed no purchase behavior. This indicates missed conversion opportunities and the need for targeted re-engagement strategies.

## âœ… Conclusion

This analysis reveals that the platform appeals strongly to younger users and that mobile/tablet users are slightly more engaged. Female users also tend to browse more pages. However, not all engagement converts to purchases, indicating a need for improvements in the user experience and conversion funnel.
